# Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I'm Luca Pesce, and I have a background in **Data Science and Engineering**.  
I'm passionate about **Machine Learning**, from data preprocessing and model building to end-to-end deployment and **MLOps**.  

- 🎓 **Education**: Studied Data Science and Engineering, where I honed my skills in statistical analysis, programming, and working with large datasets.  
- 💡 **Current Focus**: Delving deep into the entire ML pipeline, learning how to effectively deploy, scale, and monitor machine learning models using MLOps best practices.  
- 🚀 **Goals**:  
  - Master MLOps tools and frameworks (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines).  
  - Contribute to open source projects, particularly those centered on machine learning and automation.  
  - Build impactful ML solutions that solve real-world problems.  
- ⚡ **Interests**: Staying updated with the latest research in AI, experimenting with new ML libraries, and exploring cloud services for seamless deployment.
